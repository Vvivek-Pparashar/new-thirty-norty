                    I have been training with the Thirty40 team for some years
                    now. I really like the technique & tactics the coaches here
                    teach. They have trained me to play in unconventional
                    conditions which has improved my game exponentially. I have
                    got my world ranking of 1523 under the coaching of Arnav
                    Alok Goel.

                    I am a professional tennis player & have been training in
                    Spain for the last 3 years. I have had a career high ITF
                    rank of 2689. I would like to thank hirty40 for guiding me &
                    showing me the right path. They have helped me get access to
                    the best academy possible. Anyone out there looking to go
                    big in this sport, I would say Thirty40 is your place.

                    matches in Europe. I would like to thank Thirty40 for
                    helping me find a club in Germany. It was a great experience
                    & I would really recommend Thirty40 to all those looking to
                    play matches or study in Europe. They are really good at
                    what they do.

                    I would like to thank Arnav for helping me in finding the
                    perfect tennis academy for me. The academy has all the
                    necessary facilities for a player and enough indoor and
                    outdoor courts. They made sure that no session was missed
                    due to bad weather or something. They helped me improve a
                    lot, especially my backhand. I was getting personal
                    attention every day. Also, I was able to play tournaments
                    every week which was a major benefit of coming to Germany.
