              <p style={{ paddingTop: "10px" }}>
                Spain is renowned for its red clay courts, the surface used in
                the French Open. Training on clay demands different skills than
                hard courts, focusing on control, strategy, and finesse. This
                can significantly improve your overall game.

                limited playing seasons.

                Spanish scenery and culture, making it a truly enriching
                experience. Some academies even offer Spanish language classes
